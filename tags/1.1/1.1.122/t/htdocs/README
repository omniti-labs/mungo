These files are served by the test apache server.  To run the tests:

cd your-mungo-dist
perl Makefile.PL -apxs `which apxs` # may be apxs2 on some systems
make test

The ASP files here are grouped together by their test script.  
So, all files under t/htdocs/02-foo are used by the t/02-foo.t test script.
Note that not all test scripts have associated pages (eg, 01-dependencies.t)

All test comments and documentation are contained in the test script,
not in the ASP files.
